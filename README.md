## Architecture

### System

Centos 6 on 64-bit system

### Services

* **uWSGI & Flask**: Serves dynamic webpages
* **Celery**: Backend worker

* **Elasticsearch**: Current search engine, runs on Java
* **IBM DB2** (External): Current SHSID authoritative database
* **MariaDB 10**: MySQL replacement, current main relational database storage
* **Nginx**: Current fast HTTP reverse-proxy, serves custom static files directly, and proxies & caches to some other CDN services for non-custom static files, and proxies to uwsgi for dynamic content
* **Postfix**: Current main SMTP server for email-delivery
* **Redis**: Current fast key-value storage with native expiry support, for eg. cache & temporary data storage
* **SendGrid** (External): Current email relay for difficult-to-deliver situations (such as to Gmail)

* **iptables**: Firewall

## Contributing

Many softwares are required for development, testing, and deployment of this site.

### Development

#### A good IDE

Of course. You may use whatever you like. If you're having trouble making choices:

* For an old-school coder, which I don't expect especially for students, Vim & Emacs might suit you well.
* For newcomers, I recommend Sublime Text or Atom.

#### Git command line interface

Believe me, command line is easier to use and more feature-rich than graphical interfaces. And really, read the friendly manual (RTFM).

**Best Practice**: In case of a conflict, use rebase instead of merge.

#### Gulp

For build & minification. How to setup:

1. Install NodeJS & Npm
2. Go to command line (yes I'm serious)
  1. cd (change current working directory) to oclubs root directory
  2. `npm install -g gulp-cli`, on some installs, you many need to `sudo`
  3. `npm install`

For builds, just run (in a command line interface with oclubs roor directory as current working directory): `gulp`, and Gulp will watch all target files and do what it's meant to do.

### Testing

#### A supported web browser with developer tools

Having more than one browser is recommended.

#### Vagrant

This section is TODO...

### Deployment

#### SSH client

We use SSH for remote login to server. Linux knowledge is highly recommended. Remember to check if things break!

For Windows: Use PuTTY
For Mac / Linux: Use OpenSSH

This section is TODO...
