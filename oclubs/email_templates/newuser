You can also join a club by just clicking one button on Club Introduction page without any further application. Then club leaders will know you through their emails. 

In addition, all activities of clubs will be displayed on Activities page. For non-meeting activities, you can also join by clicking one button on Activity Introduction page. All activities' CAS hours will be automatically calculated, and you can check it at any time on your personal page.

Aside from that, all photos uploaded by club leaders will be displayed in Photos page. Feel free to see them.
